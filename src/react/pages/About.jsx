                    Born in 2001 in Paris, I am a 2nd year BEng Computer Science student with a passion for creative development. 
                    Beyond my studies, I am independently exploring tools that push digital experiences further, including React.js, Three.js, GLSL, and GSAP. 
                    Additionally, I am exploring the theory of UI/UX design, enabling me implement this logic when communicating with clients to build more compelling websites.  
                    I am looking for internship opportunities, learning from industry professionals and contributing to immersive, creative projects.
